- Terms Offered is now populated when available in the calendar. If not available, the corresponding terms
  will have 0 values, otherwise 1 for offered, -1 for not offered

- To avoid issues with highschool course requirements (ex. "4U Functions and Relations") derailing the prereq parser, I added a replace which translates the course requirements into 
  the recognizable signature, so highschool courses will appear as HSMATH 11U for instance. The frontend can then choose to mark all HS* courses as taken, or something.

- Ddded a table storing major/faculty restrictions, eg. "course not open to..."

- Courses that are "also available online" in the calendar now appear as dist_ed

- Fixed an issue where crosslisted courses with identical course ids would not get properly loaded into the table (ex. ACTSC 446 and STAT 446)

- Added some code to extract courses from antireq and coreq descriptions. antireq_desc often contains pivotal information about these courses, so it's unsafe to rely on the extracted courses alone
